.TH PMDA\*(IA 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmda\*(ia\f1 \- \*(Ia PMDA
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/\*(ia/pmda\*(ia\f1
[\f3\-c\f1 \f2config\f1]
[\f3\-t\f1 \f2timeout\f1]
[\f3\-u\f1 \f2user\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpmda\*(ia\fR is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
creates PCP metrics from \*(Ia endpoints, which provide HTTP based
access to application metrics.
The default \f2config\fP directory is \fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus/config.d/\fR,
see \fBSOURCES\fP below.
The default URL fetch \f2timeout\fP is \fB2\fP seconds.
The default \f2user\fP, if not specified with the \f3\-u\fP option,
is the current user.
.PP
Further details on the \*(Ia exposition format can be found at
.I https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats

.SH "URL SOURCES"
As it runs,
.B pmda\*(ia
periodically scans the
.I $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus/config.d
directory, looking for source URL files (\c
.IR *.url )
and executable scripts or binaries.
.PP
Each
.B .url
file contains one complete HTTP or HTTPS URL at which pmda\*(ia can reach a \*(Ia endpoint.
Local file access is also supported with a conventional
.I file://somepath/somefile
URL, in which case
.I somepath/somefile
should contain prometheus formatted metric data.
A remote server does not have to be up or stay running - the PMDA tolerates
remote URLs that may come and go over time.
The PMDA will relay data and metadata when/if they are available,
and will return errors when/if they are down.
PCP metric IDs and instance domain names and IDs are saved and persistently
restored when individual metric sources become available and/or when the
PMDA is restarted. 
.SH "SCRIPTED SOURCES"
Likewise, executable scripts present in the 
.I $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus/config.d
directory will be executed and the
.B stdout
stream containing \*(ia formatted metric data will be parsed as though it had come from a URL or file. 
The
.B stderr
stream from a script will be sent to the PMDA log file, which by default can be found in
.BR $(PCP_LOG_DIR)/pmcd/\*(ia.log .
.PP
Any files found in the config directory that do not have a
.B .url
suffix,
or are not executable will be ignored.

.SH "METRIC NAMING"
All metrics from a file named
.IR FOO .*
will be exported as PCP metrics with the
.I prometheus.FOO
metric name prefix.
Therefore, the FOO name must be a valid non-leaf name for PCP PMNS metric names.
If the FOO name has multiple dot-separated components, the resulting
PMNS names will include those components.
Users should avoid configurations with sources that mix levels of nesting, such as
.IR FOO.BAR.url
.IR FOO.BAZ.url
.IR FOO.url
because metrics under FOO may conflict with or hide FOO.BAR and FOO.BAZ subtrees.

.SH LIMITATIONS
.B pmda\*(ia
and
.B libpcp
internals impose some numerical constraints about the number of sources (4095),
metrics (1024) within each source, and instance domain instances for each
metric (4194304).

.SH INSTALLATION
Install the \*(Ia PMDA by using the Install script as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus
.br
      # ./Remove
.PP
\fBpmda\*(ia\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the
agent is installed or removed.
.PP
When scripts and .url files are added, removed or changed in the configuration directory,
it is usually not necessary to restart the PMDA - the changes should be detected and
managed on subsequent PCP requests to the PMDA.
.SH FILES
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus/Install\fR" 4
installation script for the \fBpmda\*(ia\fR agent
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus/Remove\fR" 4
undo installation script for the \fBpmda\*(ia\fR agent
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus/config.d/\fR" 4
contains URLs and scripts used by the \fBpmda\*(ia\fR agent as sources of \*(ia metric data.
.IP "\fB$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/prometheus.log\fR" 4
default log file for error messages from \fBpmda\*(ia\fR
.IP "\fB$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/144.*\fR" 4
files containing internal tables for metric and instance ID number persistence (domain 144).

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
