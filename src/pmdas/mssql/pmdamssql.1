.TH PMDAMSSQL 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdamssql\f1 \- Microsoft SQL Server database PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdamssql\f1 is a Performance Co-Pilot \s-1PMDA\s0 which extracts
live performance data from a running Microsoft SQL Server database server.
.SH INSTALLATION
Firstly, \f3pmdamssql\f1 requires installation of these support packages:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 4
mssql-server \-
the primary Microsoft SQL Server database package
.IP "\(bu" 4
msodbcsql17 or (msodbcsql) \-
latest Microsoft SQL Server ODBC bindings
.IP "\(bu" 4
pyodbc \-
general python ODBC module with Microsoft SQL Server support enabled
.PD
.PP
\f3pmdamssql\f1 uses a configuration file from \&\f(CW$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fR/mssql/mssql.conf
.PP
This file currently allows for two sections, one for configuring the
library that connects to SQL server, the other for authenticating with
SQL server.
.PP
.B [connection]
specifies values for the following settings:
.IP "\(bu" 4
driver \- ODBC driver string, [default: '{ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}']
.IP "\(bu" 4
server \- socket connection string, [default: 'tcp:localhost']
.IP "\(bu" 4
timeout \- connection timeout setting, in seconds [default: 2]
.PP
.B [authentication]
specifies values for the following settings:
.IP "\(bu" 4
username \- username to connect to the database [default: 'sa']
.IP "\(bu" 4
password \- password to connect to the database [default: not set]
.PD
.PP
Once this file is setup, you can access the names and values for the
mssql performance metrics by doing the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mssql
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mssql
.br
      # ./Remove
.PP
\fBpmdamssql\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed 
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the 
agent is installed or removed.
.PP
\fBpmdamssql\fR will automatically attempt to reconnect to the SQL Server
if it's connection is lost - e.g. if the SQL Server service is restarted.
.SH FILES
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mssql/mssql.conf\f1"
configuration file for \fBpmdamssql\fR
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mssql/Install\fR" 4 
installation script for the \fBpmdamssql\fR agent 
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mssql/Remove\fR" 4 
undo installation script for the \fBpmdamssql\fR agent 
.IP "\fB$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/mssql.log\fR" 4 
default log file for error messages from \fBpmdamssql\fR 
.PP
Note the usual/default value for \fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fP is
.B /var/lib/pcp/pmdas
and the default for \fB$PCP_LOG_DIR\fP is
.B /var/log/pcp
but these settings are platform dependent.
.PD
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables. 
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative 
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
