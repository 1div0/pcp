# as the early termination should kick in once mmv_genstats runs -
# there is a header line, a blank line, then one line per sample.
#
# If pmrep is slow to start, the name change may arrive on the very
# first fetch which will result in just the header lines, but it
# *must* receive the notification (and exit early) before it would
# usually exit in order for the test to pass.
