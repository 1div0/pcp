# Skip packages by distro ... these are ones that although available
# are:
# - incompatible with other pieces we need, e.g. Qt4 when other
#   packages are Qt5, or
# - fail prerequisites due to packaging botches, or
# - are bad e.g. like valgrind dumping core
#
# >= 3 fields per line (separated by while space)
# Field 1	- Distro name, as reported by whatami
# Field 2	- Distro version, as reported by whatami, - for all versions
# 		  (an alias for .*)
# Field 3	- Distro architecture, - for all architectures (alias for .*)
# Field 4 .. N	- packages that should be skipped
#
# grep(1) patterns allowed in all Fields.
