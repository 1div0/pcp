This directory captures the collective knowledge about non-PCP packages
that are required for a PCP build or PCP QA.

manifest
	This is the master list of all packages across all packaging
	frameworks, independent of distro (when more than one distro
	uses the same packaging framework).  For example the lines
	beginning "rpm?" only apply to systems where rpm(1) is the
	principal packaging framework, i.e RedHat, Fedora, SuSE SLES,
	OpenSuSE and Centos.

	This file is the principle driver for the check-vm script.

unavailable
	This file lists packages that are not available for a specific
	distro or distro and version.
