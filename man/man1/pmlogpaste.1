.TH PMLOGPASTE 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmlogpaste\f1 \- paste text into a metric in a PCP archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pmlogsize\f1
[\f3\-?\f1]
[\f3\-f\f1 \f2file\f1]
[\f3\-h\f1 \f2hostname\f1]
[\f3\-m\f1 \f2metric\f1]
[\f3\-o\f1 \f2outfile\f1]
[\f3\-t\f1 \f2timezone\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmlogpaste
takes input text from a file or command line, and writes it to a
metric in a new PCP archive. Uses 
.BR LOGIMPORT(3) 
API in achieving this. The 
.BR LOGIMPORT(3) 
API library supports the creation of PCP
archives from external sources of performance data, either in the form of historical logs and spreadsheets or from real-time sources that are not inte‚Äê
grated as a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) under the control of
.BR pmcd(1)

.PP
The main purpose of this tool is to take the already captured tool output which contains metrics and create a PCP archive from it.

.SH OPTIONS
The available command line options are:
.TP
\fB\-h\fR \fIhostname\fR, \fB\-\-hostname\fR=\fIhostname\fR
source host name for a LOGIMPORT archive. The default value is 'localhost'.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR \fItimezone\fR, \fB\-\-timezone\fR=\fItimezone\fR
source timezone for a LOGIMPORT archive. The default value is the local timezone.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR \fImetric\fR, \fB\-\-metric\fR=\fImetric\fR
metric name for a LOGIMPORT archive. The default value is 'paste.value'.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fIfile\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR=\fIfile\fR
file with input text to be archived.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fIoutfile\fR, \fB\-\-outfile\fR=\fIoutfile\fR
archive output file. The default value is 'paste'.
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage message and exit.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All are generated on standard error and are intended to be
self-explanatory.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
